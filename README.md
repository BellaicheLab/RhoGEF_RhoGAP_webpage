# RhoGEF/GAP localizations in proliferative epithelia

Link to the website : [bellaichelab.github.io/RhoGEF_RhoGAP_webpage](https://bellaichelab.github.io/RhoGEF_RhoGAP_webpage/)

This website presents the results of a research study (Link to be posted) on the subcellular localization of fluorescently tagged RhoGEF and RhoGAP proteins in Drosophila epithelia, at multiple cell stages.

## Running the Website

To run the website locally, clone or download this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Alternatively, you can view the website online by visiting the following link: [bellaichelab.github.io/RhoGEF_RhoGAP_webpage](https://bellaichelab.github.io/RhoGEF_RhoGAP_webpage/).

## Data and Images

The data and images used in the website are included in the `protein.json` and `images` directories, respectively. Images are provided in 248x284 pixels, PNG format.
